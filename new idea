how about adding dragon hybrids, let's say we take dragon DNA from an egg, mix them in a special new block and then add it to the egg and when it grows it would be a hybrid dragon with hybrid abilities, or some other new dragon, for example, which would only be obtained by adding it to the egg foreign objects DNA, letâ€™s say like a black head, it would be a dragon of darkness or a nether feather, it would be a dragon of air or sky, and so on, you get the gist
